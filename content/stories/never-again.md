**Never Again**

Love... Breakup... Break ke baad...

_Written On: Feb-14, 2018_


##### Chapter I

#### Airport
​
An announcement has been made, 'the flight will arrive at its scheduled time'. Am anxious to see him. I'm eager to talk to him. I wanted to hear his voice. A friend who is everything to call as 'dost' I never used the word to call anyone else. I'm waiting...

Flight arrived at scheduled time 0720. After waiting for about five minutes, I saw one guy with beard waved his hands towards me. Yes, He is my friend Vijay. His physique changed drastically and looking handsome with beard. But his feelings towards me remaining as before. He shouted from a distance. I might not identify him if he didn't call me by nickname.

I woke up by alarm sound at 5.A.M. I got ready before 6 because am in hurry to meet my friend after a long time. He got settled in States. We met last time when we were in Bengaluru, 5 years ago. After that we were busy in making the life better. He went to U.S., to study M.S. and decided to settle there for decade. Even though I got few opportunities to go abroad, I denied all offers and remained in Bengaluru.

He called me a week ago and told me that he want to meet me. We two are happy because meeting a best friend after nearly an half decade. Usually I won't wake up early as 5 o'clock. But today I got ready with an extra energy and am in joyous mood. I'm eager to see my friend's face, had lots of matters to talk; about our career, personal life and of course, gossips . Since there's no traffic in morning, I took only 20 minutes to reach the airport.

My face broadened with joy and I started giggling. He walked towards me swiftly. And suddenly he gave me firm hug. Only the gesture is enough to understand how much he missed me. Someone invented the hug so that you don't need to have a single word. We were separated and stared at each other with a bright smile on faces. And he asked, "Hi, how are you my dear friend? You're still the same Sandy as how you were before." I blushed once again and said," Hmm. But you became too much handsome that I can't resist my eyes from staring at you." I forgot to ask how he is. Instead I started admiring his physique. Because I don't have such a charm. He turned towards me and said, "oh..! Really?" I just nodded my head in positive way. I didn't get how to continue conversation even though I have lots of questions in my mind. So I told him to wait for a minute and walked towards parking lot.

##### Chapter II

#### Home


"I told you something when I called you last week. Do you remember?", he asked suddenly in the middle of the breakfast. I lifted my head and looked at him with a bewildered expression. I tried to recall our conversation of his call. But I didn't found any matter with important or noteworthy words that could make sense in his question.

After returning from the airport, am busy in preparing the breakfast. I applied leave for a day, so that I can spend time with him. Vijay took rest and got refreshed. I turned on the T.V. and served him Dosa and Sambar. And I sat beside him on the sofa. We were watching news without a single word. After about 5 minutes of silence, he suddenly asked that question.

I continued to stare him with mouth wide open and stopped my hand in midair. He asked the same question once again and I had no other answer. I said "No. Am not remembering. Sorry. Tell me."

With a smile on face, he said, "It's okay. Actually I didn't told you anything about what I wanted ­­to tell you. That day I told you that I have to tell you something. But... I will tell you everything about her who left me in middle of  the ocean without a word, in a dead silence. I never met her again. Once we were best friends and now...", he paused for couple of seconds and continued, "Now we have to call ourselves as 'Old Best Friends'. Literally... she's my girlfriend." He looked straight into my eyes. I'm hearing every words coming out from his mouth. Sorry, it's actually from his heart. I'm in complete disbelief that he too had a love story. I didn't know, am going to hear a cutest love story that I'm going to write a story in near future with a terrible tragic end in it. Damn true..! But I didn't know the fact at that time.­­

##### Chapter III

#### Falling Yellow Rose turned to Red Before Reaching The Ground

We hugged in the middle of the road for about five minutes. There is no chance of getting second thought in our mind. We were blind and just crying in a desolated road with our bodies attached without having a space in between. Cold breeze, falling yellow leaves and red rays of sun.

I'm trying to close my eyes forcefully. But am not getting sleep. I'm thinking why she's is not replying to my messages, what might be the mistake I committed. She is not talking to me in the tuition classes either. Yeah, Am thinking about Amrutha, my tuition friend since 10th Standard, more than that she's is my best friend. Sorry, in her view, may be an old friend.


We were going to same college for tuition. Since am a shy guy, we never had a conversation, not even a single 'Hi' in the first year. But one day we were sitting in the class and one of the teacher informed that our tuition sir will not come so we can leave. My friends started to run out of the classes but I couldn't. I can't say it as ' I couldn't ' because while tried to run out she was in my way. So I stopped at an instance but I couldn't make it. I lost control and hit on her right shoulder with my head. I lifted my head to ask for an apology. I couldn't make an eye contact. My body is shivering with fear that what if she scolds in front of all girls. But instead of exasperating on me, she asked me if I got hurt. What the..! Her voice is...! Damn.. her voice is so sweet. I lisped in low voice, "No... So.. So.. Sorry." And ran out of the tuition hall. Am running till the laughing sounds of girls fade away.


But next day, after the classes she met me outside the classes and introduced herself. We became friends in a few weeks and I came to know that her home is also in nearby mine. We were walking till her home even though we have bicycle. I need not tell you that we exchanged our contact numbers. We were chatting on Whatsapp till midnight. We became so close that we started to share non-veg jokes.

Everything was smooth until the friendship day. I wished her with a friendship quote.  Sending a wish is not a mistake. But a message with 'cute', 'beautiful', 'Angel' are the biggest mistakes that you make in while sending a text. You can guess it, it's a friendship quote with cuteness overloaded. It led to something else that I never expected. But I got a surprise reply, "U r more dan a frnd. I lyk u very much. I'm missing you." I called her and tried to console her that we can't be a couple since we both were from different castes and our parents will never accept our love and will create a problem. Even after an hour, she's not ready to accept the reality. She has only one thought in her mind, that's me and only me. But I'm not in the situation to accept the reality. But I took a harsh decision that broke her heart into pieces; I started to avoid her in each and every possible way. I shifted to last bench which is right beside the door so that I can move out swiftly after the end of the classes. But you can't imagine or have a think of falling for someone before you are. And sky will not be clear all the time.


One day I received a message from her in Whatsapp in the noon. She is very sad and feeling alone because am avoiding her and is crying for the same. Uff... I'm in dilemma because if I consoled her or did something that will make her comfort then it will be a worst part for me but... if I neglected her message and she harmed herself..? it will be 'The End' for me. Whatever it might be, worst thing is reserved for me. So I chosen the worst part still better than the second one; I replied to her message. Hey.. hey... I'm still okay. Don't shout. Am still in line. I'm not done yet. I sent her a single sentence reply -'I think you need a nice hug.' She replied before I blink my eyes for the second time after watching double tick turned to blue. She wanted to meet me so requested to wait in our routine place. Without a second thought  I took my bicycle and started to peddle as fast as possible.

When I reached the place, I saw her standing beside her bicycle. The moment my legs touched the ground, she ran towards me and hugged me tightly. she's crying. I couldn't open my mouth. I remained silent and her tears rolled down on her cheeks and reached my shoulder, the destination.

She became normal after five minutes of hug which I have suggested her. Now I'm happy that it's not a worst part as I thought before. It's really a nice hug. You will forget everything, your mind will fill with some kind of relief that you can't express in words. Sorry, not possible even with the paragraphs.

She moved two steps backward and moved towards me swiftly. Before I could think anything else, her soft rosy lips touched my cheeks. Huh.. Am dumbstruck and my eyes were wide open. I'm in fear because what will be the result if any media person is hiding nearby and focussing his camera lens towards us with 2x zoom. Ha Ha... it's true. They thoughts are limited to TRP, so they'll set MRP. Damn truth...!

Our eyes met and we were standing there in the middle of the road, falling in each other's eyes. The next few days were filled with sweetness before sourness occupied it's place. It's the day when my mom saw a message which I was received while am sleeping. It's not a tragedy but tragic fact is that my mom knows her mom. It became more worst after my mom informed her mom about our matter. You may call it as 'complaint'. She was warned by her mom to stop all these things. But my mom neither scolded nor informed me about all these progresses. She stopped talking to me. She started to avoid. I'm helpless now and I realized the pain of avoidance by the person you love. We completed our 12th class. After that I never saw her again. But one sign board always laughs at me which is standing near the end of the road where we our love life started, "THE END"?

##### Chapter IV

#### Never Again

I opened the gate slowly and walked towards the entrance of a large house of my best friend. Sorry, in his view, may be an old friend. A little cute girl, about four years of age, is playing in the soil. She ran inside the house, the moment she saw a new person. Yes, of course. I'm visiting his house for the first time. After our breakup, you can't call it as official though, I never tried to talk or meet him. But few months ago, one of our common friend gave me his contact number and invited to her house. So today is the day I'm going to see the person with whom I shared my teenage years, unforgettable years.

Sandhya a.k.a Sandy came out, holding hands of her daughter and welcomed us to her home. After exchange of wellness, she went to kitchen to bring tea. She's happy that I accepted her invitation and visited her house.

My ten year old son Vijay and Sandhya's daughter started playing the game. I asked her name to start conversation with her. I'm really shocked. My eyes filled with tears. I'm really happy, but I'm helpless to do anything. Because mistakes were in the past, so I can't go back to correct it or even anyone else could. I repeated the same sentence of Vijay which was his complement when I introduced myself to him in tuition class - "Amrutha, your name is as beautiful as you are...!"

**THE END**

> 90% out of cent are not successful teenage love stories. Most of the people move on by forgetting or forgiving the past, few of them will surrender themselves and ends their life. But few people will move on and see their  past love in their beloved children.
